### PART A: INITIAL SETUP

* I created a small React App environment for this project.
* This environment is ready for further development.
* Webpack was used for bundle and optimizing all js, css and html files.
* I used embedded font-face fonts in order to improve performance.
* I chose SCSS as pre-processor for its flexibility and modularity. I think SCSS is clearer than SASS and more powerful than LESS. Hence my choice.
* Several modules were added in order to increase performance: "autoprefixer", "uglify-js", "file-loader", etc.
* I used the "Axios" library for handling the API / HTTP requests. This library has proven to be optimal for browser compatibility.

### PART B: HTML / CSS

* The overall design comes strictly from the image provided. No header / footer or other sections were added. Just the advertisements.
* General sizes (fonts, widths) were set relatively to a main container with standard measures.
* I provided a minimum responsive functionality, just adapting the number of items per row.
* SCSS rules were separated in different components for more readability and better scalability.
* I didn't use any bootstrap grids nor naming conventions (BEM, Atomic, SMACSS, etc.) for this is a very small project. I used some simple conventional names.

### PART C: javascript / API

* I've used vanilla javascript and JSX (no Jquery or other libraries).
* I used ES6 and tried to be as succinct as possible on every file / component.

### PART D: Test
